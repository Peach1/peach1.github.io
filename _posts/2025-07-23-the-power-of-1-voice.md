# The power of 1 voice.

Does a single human, does 1 single mind, have the power to change the world?
The power to upend all the corrupt principalities of the present day; and establish a different future? Can 1 human voice awaken the sovereignty of other humans? 

It's possible for sure, a single human has the ability to have a profound impact on the future. Just sharing from experience, 1 human has the power to highlight and bring things to attention which the mainstream has dismissed or long forgotten about.

1 human can afford to take risk that an entire industry is too scared to talk about.

# The early 2000s was all about the power of a single voice.

Man, the early 2000s needs to come back again, cause it was the last time humans were foundationally creative.

The file format I write this blog on - [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - was started because 1 person in the early 2000s had a good idea; the idea caught on, and now major industries use `.md` format as their foundation, all because 1 blogger posted the idea online.

Millions of `.md` files, github, blogs and valuable documentation - influenced by the voice of 1!

...

Now think about how much further humanity can go.

1 human has the power to upend the status quo, or create a new status quo entirely.

Humans are not limited by statistics, or news cycles, or trends. We have the power to create original things.

We are not limited by corporations, if you have the knowledge and resources, no one can stop you from creating your own future far removed from what corporations promote.

We humans are not limited by man-made things, we humans have the power to create. We have the power to create media and technology that overrides existing power structures. Outside of the status quo.

Perhaps we humans need to be creators instead of consumers.

And we have to be smart enough to think for ourselves, instead of being conditioned by someone else's programming.

In 2025, the most important question of our generation is:

**Do you think we can depend on large corporations forever?**

There comes a time where people are pushed to think for themselves and create their own destiny.

That day starts today.

I want a future where people think.

I want a future where humans dream.

I want a future where glass-screen addiction is something of the past.



I think we should rediscover computer programming - systems programming, and master the history of what's been written for computers.

Time to create our own future, the good old fashioned way.



Give people the power to build things for themselves, and you create wealth.

Give people the tools to think for themselves, and you change the world.
